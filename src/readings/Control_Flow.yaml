    - "panic!"
    - "Result option"

    In this video, we look at how we can use the Result and Option Enums to deal with Errors in Rust. 
    We also look at some of the basic methods that are commonly used in place of pattern match statements to check errors. 
    * Error handling using Result options
    * Error handling using Enum options
    * Error handling using ? operations 
    * Error handling using Panic!
