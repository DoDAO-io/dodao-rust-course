##### What is the output of the following code snippet:
 
    ``` 
        fn main() {
          let x = 12;
          println!("The value of x is: {x}");
          x = 8;
          println!("The value of x is: {x}");
        } 
    ```
  

- [ ]  The value of x is: 8
- [ ]  Error: the variable x is mutable
- [ ]  The value of x is: 12
- [x]  Error: the variable x is immutable
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Error would occur, because the variable x isn't set as mutable so it's value can't be changed.
