 In this video we're looking how to write control flow in Rust language.
This video explains about the use of -
* if-else and nested else condition and using if in a let Statement
* while loop statement and passing conditions while the statement is true
* for loop and iteration
    
 
 Sub Topics: if-statement, loop

 In this video, we look at how we can use the Result and Option Enums to deal with Errors in Rust. 
We also look at some of the basic methods that are commonly used in place of pattern match statements to check errors. 
* Error handling using Result options
* Error handling using Enum options
* Error handling using ? operations 
* Error handling using Panic!
    
 
 Sub Topics: panic-not-panic, result-option, options
